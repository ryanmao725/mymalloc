Workload E:
For Workload E, we wanted to test our malloc function's capability and efficiency for merging free memory space.
For example, if we were to malloc three t-sized pointers in succession, then free the memory starting from the middle, then the malloc function should consolidate the individual free memory spaces.
Our plan is as follows:
    Allocate 51 1 byte pointers.
    Free the 26th pointer (the middle one).
    Going outward from the middle in both directions, free the rest of the pointers.
    Repeat this 150 times in succession.

Workload F:
